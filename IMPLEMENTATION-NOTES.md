# Notification Worker Restructuring Implementation Notes

## Overview

The notification worker service has been restructured to simplify its architecture and focus on its core responsibility: receiving notification data from various parsers and storing it in the database. The restructuring aims to:

1. **Reduce Complexity**: Eliminate processor-specific routing and database availability checks
2. **Improve Reliability**: Focus on core functionality with fewer failure points
3. **Standardize Processing**: Process all notification messages uniformly, regardless of source

## Changes Made

### 1. New Notification Processor

Created `src/services/notification-processor.js` containing a single function for processing notification messages:

```javascript
export async function createNotificationsFromMessage(message) {
  // Implementation focused solely on extracting notification data 
  // and calling createNotification function
}
```

This centralizes notification creation logic in one place with a clear responsibility.

### 2. Simplified Message Processing

Updated `src/services/pubsub/processor.js` to:

- Remove processor type routing (`PROCESSOR_MAP`)
- Remove complex validation and database connectivity checks
- Use a single processing path for all messages
- Focus on basic message validation and error handling

The revised flow now is:
1. Parse message JSON
2. Basic validation of required fields
3. Process message with the unified notification processor
4. Handle errors with appropriate retries

### 3. Simplified Database Service

Updated `src/services/database.js` to:

- Remove complex connection state tracking
- Simplify initialization and connectivity checks
- Keep core functionality for queries, RLS context, and transactions
- Provide more direct error handling

### 4. Added Test Support

Created `test-notification-processor.js` to help test the notification processor independently.

### 5. Files Removed (Pending)

The following files should be removed as they are no longer needed:

- `src/processors/boe.js`
- `src/processors/real-estate.js`

## Testing

To test the restructured service:

1. Run the test script: `node test-notification-processor.js`
2. Test with real messages: Use the Cloud PubSub console to publish test messages to the subscription

## Backward Compatibility

The restructured service maintains backward compatibility with existing message formats. It extracts the same fields from the messages and creates notifications with the same data structure.

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor in Production**: Watch for any issues with processing different message types
2. **Standardize Message Format**: Collaborate with parser services to standardize the notification message format
3. **Complete Cleanup**: Remove processor-specific files once the new implementation is stable

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Code Simplicity**: Reduced complex conditional logic and eliminated redundant code
2. **Maintainability**: Clearer responsibility boundaries make future changes easier
3. **Resilience**: Simplified error handling with focused retry strategies
4. **Consistency**: Uniform processing regardless of notification source

## Deployment Notes

Deploy this update gradually:

1. Deploy to a test environment first
2. Run validation tests with various message formats
3. Monitor error rates and processing performance
4. Roll out to production with increased monitoring
