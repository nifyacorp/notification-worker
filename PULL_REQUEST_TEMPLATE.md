# Notification Worker Rebuild

## Overview

This PR implements the notification worker rebuild following the domain-driven design architectural principles outlined in the rebuild plan.

## Changes

- Completely refactored architecture using TypeScript
- Implemented domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Improved observability and monitoring
- Added comprehensive type safety
- Implemented resilient database and PubSub connections
- Created standardized message processing pipeline

## Testing

- Unit tests for domain entities
- Integration tests for core functionality
- Manual verification of message processing
- Verified type safety and compilation

## Migration Plan

The changes have been implemented as a parallel codebase in `src-new/` to allow for a phased migration:

1. Initially, run the old implementation in production
2. Deploy the new implementation in shadow mode (processing messages without side effects)
3. Once verified, gradually shift traffic to the new implementation
4. Finally, remove the old codebase
