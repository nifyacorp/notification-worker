# Notification Worker - Remaining Issues

## Fixed Issues
- ✅ Removed duplicate `processMessage` function declaration in `index.js`
- ✅ Fixed the missing export of `connectionState` from `database/client.js`
- ✅ Health endpoint is working correctly

## Remaining Issues
1. **Database Diagnostics Endpoint:** The `/diagnostics/database` endpoint is returning HTML content instead of the expected JSON. This could indicate:
   - A routing issue in the HTTP server
   - An error in the request handling that's causing a default response
   - A potential issue with the content type headers

2. **Database Connection SQL Error:** The backend service is reporting a SQL syntax error related to parameterized queries. This suggests:
   - A potential issue with how the queries are prepared
   - Possibly differences in PostgreSQL driver versions or configurations
   - Need to check the actual SQL being executed

## Next Steps
1. Debug the database diagnostics endpoint to ensure it returns proper JSON responses:
   - Check HTTP response headers and content type settings
   - Add additional logging to capture response generation
   - Verify the route handling logic

2. Address the SQL syntax errors:
   - Review SQL queries in the diagnostics endpoints
   - Ensure proper parameterization of queries
   - Check for PostgreSQL version compatibility issues

3. Test notification creation functionality:
   - Verify the `/diagnostics/create-notification` endpoint
   - Test with different user IDs to confirm RLS functionality
   - Validate that notifications are properly accessible to their owners

## Deployment Instructions
Use the provided `deploy.sh` script to build and deploy the fixed service:
```bash
cd notification-worker
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
