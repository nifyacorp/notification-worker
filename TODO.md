# Notification Worker - Remaining Issues

## Fixed Issues
- ✅ Removed duplicate `processMessage` function declaration in `index.js`
- ✅ Fixed the missing export of `connectionState` from `database/client.js`
- ✅ Health endpoint is working correctly
- ✅ Added extensive debug logging to the `/diagnostics/database` endpoint
- ✅ Fixed SQL syntax error in backend diagnostic endpoint by standardizing query format

## Remaining Issues
1. **Database Diagnostics Endpoint:** The `/diagnostics/database` endpoint is returning HTML content instead of the expected JSON. This should be resolved with the latest changes that include:
   - Additional request path and headers logging
   - Response data logging before sending
   - Normalized SQL format to avoid parameter substitution issues

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated code:
   - See `update-notes.md` for deployment instructions
   - Test the deployed endpoints to verify fixes

2. Test the endpoints:
   - Use the `test-diagnostics.js` script for local testing
   - Test the health endpoint to confirm basic functionality  
   - Test the database diagnostics endpoint with a test user ID
   - Test notification creation to confirm RLS functionality

3. Monitor application logs:
   - Check Cloud Logging for request path and headers information
   - Verify if the correct endpoint handler is being called
   - Check for any SQL or application errors

## Testing Scripts
1. `test-diagnostics.js` - A Node.js script for testing the service endpoints locally
2. `test-rls.sh` - A shell script for testing RLS functionality

## Deployment Instructions
Use the provided `deploy.sh` script to build and deploy the fixed service:
```bash
cd notification-worker
# For Windows PowerShell, run these commands individually:
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/delta-entity-447812-p2/notification-worker
gcloud run deploy notification-worker --image gcr.io/delta-entity-447812-p2/notification-worker --platform managed --region us-central1 --project delta-entity-447812-p2 --allow-unauthenticated
